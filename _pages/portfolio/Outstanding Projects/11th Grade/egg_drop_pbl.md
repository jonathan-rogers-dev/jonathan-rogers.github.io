# Overview
In Physics STEM Honors, we were tasked with creating a device that would allow an egg to be dropped from a height of approxamately 5.19 meters without damage. During this project, I worked alone to build, test, and produce content for the device.

# Device Requirements
- Only 2 people per team
- Only 1 Egg given by Mr. Stroupe (If you receive a second egg, 10 points will be deducted from your grade)
- Not allowed to use more than 250 toothpicks
- The container must be held together with no more than 6 hot glue sticks. (If you have to use any additionally glue sticks 1 point will be deducted from your grade for each glue stick used)
- No more than 5 cotton balls
- The apparatus must have a geometric design
- The egg cannot be coated with any glue
- No method of slowing the eggâ€™s descent is allowed (Example: No parachutes)
- The egg must be accessible for inspections

# Project
## Research
I began working on the project by completing research on different designs and methods of egg dropping. I also completed research on how to make my device stable and efficient. I concluded that using many triangles on the design in addition to a weight distribution system would give the egg the best chance of surviving the drop.
